An R Package of Data Sets About the World's Languages.

Last update: `r Sys.Date()`

### Overview

The worldlanguages package provides a series of data sets with information about the languages of the world. 
All the data is freely available and scrapped from the internet.

### Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```
remotes::install_github("jvcasillas/worldlanguages")
```

### Datasets

```{r}
#| label: toc
#| echo: false
#| results: 'asis'
#
# Automate TOC
#
# Get list of folders in current directory
datasets <- dir(path = "./data", pattern = "*.rda")

# remove .rda
list_elements <- gsub('.rda', '', datasets)

# Use dataframe names for link references
link_names <- paste0('[', list_elements, ']')
#
# Get section ref for link
#
# initialize vector
link_ref <- vector(mode = 'character', length = length(link_names))

# store assignment number
for (element in 1:length(list_elements)) {

  link_ref[element] <- paste0("(#", list_elements[element], ")")

}

# Combine everything into an unordered list
cat(paste0('- ', link_names, link_ref, '\n'))
```

#### `extinct_languages`

#| fig.retina: 2
#| echo: false
glimpse(extinct_languages)

extinct_languages %>% 
  group_by(century) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  mutate(century = as.factor(century),
